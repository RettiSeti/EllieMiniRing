# Making Your Own

The versions with a blank back are for attaching a common pin backer to them, whereas the versions with a post on the back are for inserting into a spinner ring. There are no readily avaliable blank spinner rings so you have to buy a pre-finished one, remove the existing charm, and insert the new one, securing it with a press fit or glue. 

Purchased rings such as [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804546451098.html?) may not be identical, which is why the designs are provided as .step files. If they do not fit, you can modify them to fit.

The Basic Codebug Charm is designed to be printed with a normal FDM 3D printer and a 0.4mm nozzle, whereas the others are too complex and have to be printed using a resin printer. If you want to get the authentic metal feel of the pins, you can try electroplating the print.


You could also directly machine the designs with a CNC mill, but what kind of maniac has that kind of equipment? ;)

## Painting

The originals were painted using Testors enamel paint ~~because I don't know what I'm doing~~. However, other paints will work but they may not be as durable.

# Bonus

While I was working on painting these, Bo started a stream which turned into him watching a 10 hour video of paint drying, which turned out to be a loop. He then mentioned he would watch it if anyone wanted to record a real video of paint drying for 10 hours. (clip of him saying it below) Who would possibly be stupid enough to spend their time doing that?
